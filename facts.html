    <h2>Alzheimer's Disease.  What is it?</h2>
	<p class="facts">Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible brain disorder that progressively affects cognitive functioning such as thinking, remembering, 
		and daily function activities.  It is often confused with age-related dementia and has often been termed “Old-Timers”, but they are, in fact, 
		not the same.  Dementia may be a symptom of Alzheimer’s, but is not age-related, although it is a risk factor.  Truth is scientists are still learning 
		about Alzheimer’s Disease.  The cause is unknown – it could be hereditary, environmental, and/or lifestyle.  </p>
	  <p class="facts">It was first termed in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer after examining the brain tissue of a women who had symptoms of memory loss and hallucinations.  
		Though only 55 years old at the time of her death, her brain tissue showed great abnormalities.  He found clumps of amyloid plaques and tangled bundles of 
		fibers (tau tangles).   We now know these are some of the features of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

   <h2>Alzheimer's Disease.  Signs and Symptoms</h2>
	<p class="facts">Sometimes the changes affecting the brain may actually happen a decade before signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's may appear.  Symptoms may vary from 
		person to person, but the most common symptom is memory loss - forgetting to take medication, forgetting important dates, and repeating questions are common.  Problem 
		solving challenges may also present itself with Alzheimer's Disease.  Following a recipe may become more difficult, as well as handling the financial affairs such as paying 
		bills on time.  Confusion is also often seen with Alzheimer's Disease.  Losing track of time, date, and seasons may become more frequent with the progression of the disease.  
		Some may notice mood changes with Alzheimer's Disease.  Suspicion, agitation, fear, and anxiety can often be seen with someone dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
