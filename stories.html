    <h3>Laurie B., Previous Community Service Educator for Memory Assessment Clinic</h3>
		<p class="stories"><i>I meet with patients and care partners immediately after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease has been delivered. Reactions and emotions from both patients and care partners 
			always vary. Some patients and families may include grief, loss, anger, shock, fear, disbelief and even relief. Some feel afraid about what is going happen in the future, scared about
			moments of confusion, forgetfulness and not knowing a spouse or child, and some are upset about how this disease will impact loved ones. Some patients are already in the later stages 
			of Alzheimer’s Disease and simply do not understand what this diagnosis even means for them. Regardless of the emotions that fill the room, it is my responsibility to provide families
			education on the disease itself and how to move forward after receiving a diagnosis of an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that has no cure.

			While there is no cure or ways to stop the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease currently, there are other treatment options. Treating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease is key to successful caregiving and improved 
			quality of life. I spend a lot of time making sure that patients and care partners understand the available options. We discuss the importance of learning and educating oneself about the 
			disease, medications, treatments for challenging behaviors. Knowing about what to expect as the disease progresses will help care partners be able to better plan and react.

			I also spend a lot of time discussing self-care and taking advantage of community resources. Care partners are not alone and should not try to do everything alone. Care partners that are providing care for individuals 
			living with Alzheimer’s Disease are much more likely to develop more health problems. I always stress the importance of building a care team and utilizing services such has home delivered meals, 
			homemaker services, in-home support services, support groups, respite, hospice, etc. that are often free from local community partners. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient 
			and care partners and make plans for the future, instead of waiting until one is in a crisis situation. There is help available throughout the journey.</i></p>

	<h3>Debbie L., Caregiver</h3>
	<p class="stories"><i>
		I am the sole caregiver for my mother who is in her 90s.  She started having Alzheimer's symptoms about 12 years ago.  I first started noticing some mood swings and some behavior that 
	was a tad hard to deal with.  She was downright mean at times, but nothing I could not handle.  She was living with me and pretty much had most of her independence, but one day I had
	to take away her keys forever.  I woke up early one morning and found that Mom was not in her bedroom and her car was missing from the carport.  I called the police department and asked them to 
	be on the lookout for her.  We drove by our old childhood house and she was not there.  After a few hours of searching, the police department found her sitting in the waiting room of the hospital.
	Apparantly, Mom thought she had a doctor's appointment and drove herself to the hospital.  When she got there she didn't know why she was there and couldn't remember how to get home, so she sat in
	the waiting room for hours.  Though she was hesitent to give up her driving independence, she obliged.  There were still a few arguements that followed though.</br></br>

	I had to put Mom in assisted living.  It wasn't something I wanted to do, but had to do.  I worried that she would wander off, and to be honest, she became more hostile as time went on.  The silver lining
	is she is doing absolutely wonderful there.  She is absolutley thriving!  She plays Bingo daily and has made a lot of friends.  I try to visit her everyday and she remembers me every day.  My brother came to visit
	from out of town recently and she looked at him with a blank stare.  She couldn't remember him, but remembered his wife.  The next day, she was back to her old self again and laughed and joke with him.
	Though there are some trying times, Mom is in good health.  She has been discharged from Hospice services three times already!  She is one tough lady.  She was even diagnosed with COVID-19 a few months ago (at 93) 
	and she conquered it.  I can't wait until this pandemic is over so I can hold her again!</i></p>

	<h3>Julie M., Nurse Practitioner for Memory Assessment Clinic</h3>
	<p class="stories"><i>
			Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. It is a very emotional diagnosis for the patient and care partners. Problems may include wandering, difficulty paying bills, trouble communicating, and 
			inability to complete daily tasks. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, so the goal is to slow the progression. Research has shown that if caught in the early stages, some cholinesterase inhibitors may help slow 
			the progression of the disease. Donepezil and Memantine are two of the most common drugs used presently. Education and safety concerns are extremely important for the patient and the care partners as well.
			</br></br>
			The Memory Assessment Clinic (MAC) is one of five clinics in the state of Ga dedicated to the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. MAC’s are referral clinics, not comprehensive care centers. The goal of our 
			clinic is to enhance clinical services and community support, not to replace any aspect of the patient’s current care. A typical evaluation at the MAC only involves two appointments; an initial diagnostic assessment and then a follow up visit to 
			review the diagnosis and care plan, and to discuss support and educational resources. A detailed report from the MAC, including test results, diagnosis and a care plan, is then sent to the PCP for follow up and continuing care.
			</br></br>
			I initially meet with patients and their care partners to discuss concerns related to changes in the patient’s memory. Some of the patients have noticed a problem while others do not feel like they have any problem whatsoever and think they are just 
			fine. The caregiver plays a key role in helping me understand some of the changes that have taken place. After discussion with the patient and caregiver, I perform a mental neurological physical exam on the patient that consist of mental status, motor 
			function and balance, sensory exam, reflexes, and coordination. Following that a MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test), PHQ-9 test to screen for depression, and a GAD 7 test to screen for anxiety is performed. If the patient scores well enough on 
			the MOCA (usually 13 or better), more advanced testing is done which includes pattern comparison, delayed memory recall, animal fluency, etc. Labs are drawn and the patient is then scheduled for an MRI without contrast. A diagnosis is given usually at 
			the follow up visit after all testing, labs, and MRI are reviewed.</i></p>

	<h3>Rusty H.</h3>
	<p class="stories"><i>
	We didn't know Papa had Alzheimer's at first.  We didn't know much about the disease.  We thought it was just age.  Before our family reunions, we 
	would take bets on how many times he would tell the same story.  Looking back that was pretty cruel, but it was funny at the time.  His favorite story 
	was about my older sister.  When he was babysitting her one day, she saw a hat at the five and dime and climbed a pole to get it.  Sometimes, he would repeat that 
	story five minutes after he just told us.  Papa was a stubborn man though and he refused to come to terms with the Alzheimer's diagnosis.  He still drove to town
	and back which wasn't a very good idea.  He once backed up into the hardware store and took off.</br></br>

	Papa passed away at 88.  He taught me so much and I can see a lot of him in me.  We didn't know much about Alzheimer's Disease back then and didn't know how to 
	help him.  If only I could hear Papa tell that story of my sister just one more time.</i></p>
