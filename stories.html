  		  <p class="first">I think most of us have known someone with Alzheimer's or know someone who has been directly affected by Alzheimer's Disease.
		  It's certainly not an easy diagnosis to hear.  I think what is so scary about this diagnosis is not really knowing how 
			  much of an impact it will have on our loved one's life and our own.  My grandmother once left the house in the middle of night thinking she had an early 
			doctor's appointment, but when she got to the hospital, she did not remember why she was sitting there.  She sat in the waiting room for hours trying to figure out
		why she was there.  She was found hours later after my aunt woke up and realized she was gone and alerted officials that she was found.  Thank goodness she was safe.  
		Truth is when she realized she didn't know how she got there or why, she decided to stay put.  SHe has more good days than bad which we are thankful, but we are not
		out of the woods.  There are days she can look at my dad and look right through him and not know who he is.  Then there are days she can laugh and joke with the best of them!</p>
