  		  <p class="first">I think most of us have known someone with Alzheimer's or know someone who has been directly affected by Alzheimer's Disease.
		  It's certainly not an easy diagnosis to hear.  I think what is so scary about this diagnosis is not really knowing how 
			  much of an impact it will have on our loved one's life and our own.  My grandmother once left the house in the middle of night thinking she had an early 
			doctor's appointment, but when she got to the hospital, she did not remember why she was sitting there.  She sat in the waiting room for hours trying to figure out
		why she was there.  She was found hours later after my aunt woke up and realized she was gone and alerted officials that she was found.  Thank goodness she was safe.  
		Truth is when she realized she didn't know how she got there or why, she decided to stay put.  SHe has more good days than bad which we are thankful, but we are not
		out of the woods.  There are days she can look at my dad and look right through him and not know who he is.  Then there are days she can laugh and joke with the best of them!</p>

    <h3>Laurie B., orevious Community Service Educator for Memory Assessment Clinic</h3>
		<p class="first">I meet with patients and care partners immediately after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease has been delivered. Reactions and emotions from both patients and care partners 
			always vary. Some patients and families may include grief, loss, anger, shock, fear, disbelief and even relief. Some feel afraid about what is going happen in the future, scared about
			moments of confusion, forgetfulness and not knowing a spouse or child, and some are upset about how this disease will impact loved ones. Some patients are already in the later stages 
			of Alzheimer’s Disease and simply do not understand what this diagnosis even means for them. Regardless of the emotions that fill the room, it is my responsibility to provide families
			education on the disease itself and how to move forward after receiving a diagnosis of an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that has no cure.

While there is no cure or ways to stop the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease currently, there are other treatment options. Treating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease is key to successful caregiving and improved 
			quality of life. I spend a lot of time making sure that patients and care partners understand the available options. We discuss the importance of learning and educating oneself about the 
			disease, medications, treatments for challenging behaviors. Knowing about what to expect as the disease progresses will help care partners be able to better plan and react.

I also spend a lot of time discussing self-care and taking advantage of community resources. Care partners are not alone and should not try to do everything alone. Care partners that are providing care for individuals 
			living with Alzheimer’s Disease are much more likely to develop more health problems. I always stress the importance of building a care team and utilizing services such has home delivered meals, 
			homemaker services, in-home support services, support groups, respite, hospice, etc. that are often free from local community partners. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient 
			and care partners and make plans for the future, instead of waiting until one is in a crisis situation. There is help available throughout the journey.</p>
